**ToS: Trains of Sought** is a term that describes a new approach to context in ontonlogies


Definitions
===========

1. *Context: Definition 1 (traditional, facets)* 
	There is one item -- normally a node in ontology graph,  and one or more facets associated with the item. Facets function as context by making it possible to isolate a subset of search results.  There need to be as many search queries as the are items that have to be found. 

2. *Context: Definition 2 (proposed, ToS)* 
	There are multiple items in each ontology node and there are multiple nodes.  Context is a structure overlaying these nodes.  One feature is the ability to browse the structure discovering new nodes and items in the process without having to issue new search queries.
